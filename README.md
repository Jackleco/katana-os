Arch Linux for geeks that want customization mixed with functionality.
**WARNING**
Updates are not too common because this is a side project.
If an update has not been released for a long time, DO NOT WAIT FOR ME TO UPDATE IT. SECURITY RISKS WILL HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T UPDATE WHEN I DON'T!
If that warning has not deterred you, Welcome to Geek Arch!
